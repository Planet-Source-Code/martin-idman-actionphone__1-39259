### Description

Use your modem to annoy your friends! This little app will use your modem and call your friends in different intervalls. You can also use a list of several numbers it can randomize from. Use only on friends and have fun! Added new feature!
 
### More Info
 
You need a modem.

Someone might not like beeing called all the time. I use it on a friend that persists on calling me every time he's out late.
